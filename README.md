No non-standard hardware or other software should be required

## Installation:
Expected time <30 seconds
1. Download zip file, decompress
2. Within MATLAB, navigate into the downloaded/unzipped folder "turbulence-scaling-code" 

## Instructions for use & figure reproduction:
To reproduce all size-abundance data and model, run the script "generate_all_figures.m"
Expected time on reasonable laptop 1-30 seconds 

### Outputs:
Figures 1, 3a, 3b, 3c
Some minor formatting, e.g. legends, are missing
