# README for code used in "Synergetic impacts of turbulence and fishing reduce ocean biomass"
Model and code developed by Jody C. McKerral

## Requirements
Requires: MATLAB, with the Optimisation Toolbox & Statistics/Machine Learning Toolbox

Scripts have been tested and known to work with the following MATLAB versions:
R2018a, R2018b, R2019b

Scripts have been tested and known to work in MATLAB on the following operating systems:
Windows 10, OSX 10.12+, Ubuntu LTS 18.04

Dependencies: 
subtightplot.m (https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39664-subtightplot)
tightfig.m (https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34055-tightfig-hfig)

No non-standard hardware or other software should be required

## Installation:
Expected time <30 seconds
1. Download zip file, decompress
2. Within MATLAB, navigate into the downloaded/unzipped folder "turbulence-scaling-code" 

## Instructions for use & figure reproduction:
Open the mlx live script (mckerral_run_analysis) and run each cell. 
Please note that the datasets are not bundled here; [email](https://www.flinders.edu.au/people/jody.fisher) if you have a request.

### Outputs:
Manuscript figures, with additional steps for ease of understanding of the methods.

### Other notes:
